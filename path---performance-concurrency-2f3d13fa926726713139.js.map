In other words, for this example: Tmax = 1 / Dcpu = 250 kb/sec</li>\\n<li>In order to increase the capacity of this application, it would first be necessary to increase CPU capacity. Increasing memory, network capacity or disk capacity would have little or no effect on performance until after CPU capacity has been increased sufficiently.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>Work Pools (Queues) &#x26; Thread Pools Working Together</strong></h3>\\n<p>Work Pools are queues of work to be performed by a software application or component.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If all threads in thread pool are busy, incoming work can be queued in work pool</li>\\n<li>Threads from thread pool, when freed can execute them later</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Work Pools cover up congestion &#x26; smoothen bursts</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A queue consisting of units of work to be performed</li>\\n<li>CONGESTION, by allowing the current (client) threads to submit work and return</li>\\n<li>BURST, over capacity transaction can buffered in work pool and executed later</li>\\n<li>Allow for caching of units of work to reduce system intensive calls —( Ex. we can perform a bulk fetch form a database instead of fetching on record at a time)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Queuing Tasks may be risky</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>One task could lock up another that would be able to continue if the queued task were to run.</li>\\n<li>Queuing can smoothen in-coming traffic burst limited in time (depending upon the rate of traffic and size)</li>\\n<li>Fails if traffic arrives on average faster than they can be processed.</li>\\n<li>In general, Work Pools are in memory so it is important to understand what the impact of restarting a system is, as in memory elements will be lost.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Bounded &#x26; Unbounded Pools (Load Shedding)</h3>\\n<p>If not bounded, pools can grow freely but can cause system to exhaust resources.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Work Pool / Queue Unbounded — (May overload Memory / Heap &#x26; crash) — Each work object in the queue stays holding the space until consumed</li>\\n<li>Thread Pool Unbounded — (May overload CPU / Native Space and Crash) — Each thread asks to be scheduled on CPU and consumes native stack space</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If queue size is bounded, incoming execute requests block when it is full. We can apply different Policies to handle t, for example</p>\\n<p>— Reject if there is no space (Can have side affects)</p>\\n<p>— Remove based on Priority — (Ex priority may be function of time — Timeouts)</p>\\n<p>Thread Pools can have different policies when Work Pools is full:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Block till there is available space — Starve (VERY BAD — Sometimes Needed)</li>\\n<li>Run in Current Thread (Very Dangerous!)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Work pool &#x26; thread pool sizes can often be traded off for each other</h3>\\n<p><strong>Large Work-Pool and small thread pools</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead.</li>\\n<li>Can lead to artificially low throughput especially if tasks frequently block (ex I/O bound)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Small Work pool generally require larger thread pool sizes</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Keeps CPUs busier</li>\\n<li>May cause scheduling overhead (Context Switching) and may lessen throughput. Especially if the number of CPUs are less.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr>\\n<p>This article is also aviable on my <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/simars/performance-concurrency-threads-throttling-memory-queues-f5672190b606?source=friends_link&#x26;sk=d17a478b5e2ca71e94ee467de99777a3\\\"><strong>Medium</strong></a> publication.
