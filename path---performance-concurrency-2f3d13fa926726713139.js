At this point, as L continues to increase, the response time R increases in proportion and through-put may then start to decrease, both due to resource contention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*clX08uls7KNzOGNpaT906g.png"></p>\n<p><em>Performance pattern of a Concurrent Process</em></p>\n<h3>How Throughput and Resource Consumption are related? (Example)</h3>\n<p>Throughput &#x26; Latency can have an inverse or direct relationship. Concurrent tasks (Threads) often contend for resources (locking &#x26; contention)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Single-Threaded — Higher Throughput = Lower Latency</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Consistent throughput, does not increase with incoming load &#x26; resources</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Processes serially, Good for batch jobs</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Response Time linearly varies with request order.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Multi-Threaded — Higher Throughput = Higher Latency (Most of the time)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Throughput may increase linearly with load, it starts to drop after threshold</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Process Concurrently, Good for interactive modules (Web Apps)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Near consistent Response Time, doesn’t vary much with order but load. Single Threaded — 10 CPU(s) Multi Threaded — 10 CPU(s) Threads = 1 Latency = .1 seconds Throughput = 1/.1 = 10 tx/sec</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cRtzxQtYReWKTghtd-TD5w.png"></p>\n<p><em>Non linear vertical scaling with threads due to cpu latency from context switching</em></p>\n<h3>Producer Consumer Principle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Utilization Law: Ui = T * Di</li>\n<li>Where Ui is the percentage of utilization of a device in the application, T is the application throughput, and Di is the service demand of the application device.</li>\n<li>The maximum throughput of an application Tmax is limited by the maximum service demand of all of the devices in the application.</li>\n<li>EXAMPLE — A load test reports 200 kb/sec average throughput:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CPUavg = 80% | Dcpu = 0.8 / 200 kb/sec = 0.004 sec/kb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Memoryavg = 30% | Dmemory = 0.3 / 200 kb/sec = 0.0015 sec/kb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Diskavg = 8% | Ddisk = 0.08 / 200 kb/sec = 0.0004 sec/kb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Network I/Oavg = 40% | Dnetwork I/O = 0.4 / 200 kb/sec = 0.002 sec/kb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>In this case, Dmax corresponds to the CPU. So, the CPU is the bottleneck device.</li>\n<li>We can use this to predict the maximum throughput of the application by setting the CPU utilization to 100% and dividing by Dcpu. In other words, for this example: Tmax = 1 / Dcpu = 250 kb/sec</li>\n<li>In order to increase the capacity of this application, it would first be necessary to increase CPU capacity. Increasing memory, network capacity or disk capacity would have little or no effect on performance until after CPU capacity has been increased sufficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Work Pools (Queues) &#x26; Thread Pools Working Together</strong></h3>\n<p>Work Pools are queues of work to be performed by a software application or component.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If all threads in thread pool are busy, incoming work can be queued in work pool</li>\n<li>Threads from thread pool, when freed can execute them later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Work Pools cover up congestion &#x26; smoothen bursts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A queue consisting of units of work to be performed</li>\n<li>CONGESTION, by allowing the current (client) threads to submit work and return</li>\n<li>BURST, over capacity transaction can buffered in work pool and executed later</li>\n<li>Allow for caching of units of work to reduce system intensive calls —( Ex. we can perform a bulk fetch form a database instead of fetching on record at a time)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Queuing Tasks may be risky</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>One task could lock up another that would be able to continue if the queued task were to run.</li>\n<li>Queuing can smoothen in-coming traffic burst limited in time (depending upon the rate of traffic and size)</li>\n<li>Fails if traffic arrives on average faster than they can be processed.</li>\n<li>In general, Work Pools are in memory so it is important to understand what the impact of restarting a system is, as in memory elements will be lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bounded &#x26; Unbounded Pools (Load Shedding)</h3>\n<p>If not bounded, pools can grow freely but can cause system to exhaust resources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work Pool / Queue Unbounded — (May overload Memory / Heap &#x26; crash) — Each work object in the queue stays holding the space until consumed</li>\n<li>Thread Pool Unbounded — (May overload CPU / Native Space and Crash) — Each thread asks to be scheduled on CPU and consumes native stack space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If queue size is bounded, incoming execute requests block when it is full. We can apply different Policies to handle t, for example</p>\n<p>— Reject if there is no space (Can have side affects)</p>\n<p>— Remove based on Priority — (Ex priority may be function of time — Timeouts)</p>\n<p>Thread Pools can have different policies when Work Pools is full:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Block till there is available space — Starve (VERY BAD — Sometimes Needed)</li>\n<li>Run in Current Thread (Very Dangerous!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Work pool &#x26; thread pool sizes can often be traded off for each other</h3>\n<p><strong>Large Work-Pool and small thread pools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead.</li>\n<li>Can lead to artificially low throughput especially if tasks frequently block (ex I/O bound)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Small Work pool generally require larger thread pool sizes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeps CPUs busier</li>\n<li>May cause scheduling overhead (Context Switching) and may lessen throughput.
